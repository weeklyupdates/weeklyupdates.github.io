      <p>Hello again.  This is the final placeholder entry.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">I don&rsquo;t really like using markdown, but why not.</a></p>

<p>It is nice to write entries in <a href="https://http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a>.  I wonder if it looks terrible.  I am typing more to see how a large paragraph looks.  Sometimes I do words per minute speedtests online.  I can type 90 words per minute.  I do it in a strange way; it is not the normal home row method.  I did not take a keyboarding class in high school, because I figured other classes would be more worth my time.  Little did I know, virtually none of the classes in my high school were worth my time.</p>

<p>And with that, this final temporary update comes to a close.  I hope you, who were lucky enough to have seen it, enjoyed it.</p>
