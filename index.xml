      <description>Hello. This week, I&amp;rsquo;ve primarily been looking at some of the fundamentals behind Bitcoin.
Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a deep dive into SHA256, with an eye toward implementing SHA1/SHA256 in Python (or C if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling ambitious) to look at some attacking possibilities. I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to pin down what specific security needs these algorithms are intended to satisfy. Thinking like an attacker, the first, best strategy for exploiting a security system is asking &amp;ldquo;What kind of attack are they trying to prevent, and how can I gain the thing that this attack intends to gain, while performing a completely different attack?</description>

      <description>Hello. This entry will detail some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past week or so, as well as describe a bit of an overview of my process.
Addressing the latter first, with papers like this, the early planning stage is generally comprised of 3 steps:
1) Clarify the question my thesis statement seeks to answer.
2) Identify an entrypoint for researching the historical and conceptual background of the topic.</description>

      <description>Hello. This blog is being maintained as part of my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis on blockchain security for John Jay&amp;rsquo;s D4CS program. I don&amp;rsquo;t really intend the updates to be weekly per se, but rather it should be updated weekly at a minimum. Entries will likely range from a few links and my comments (short or otherwise) on them, to rambles about potential security flaws in the blockchain, etc. By request, I&amp;rsquo;ll address any topics pertaining to CSCI 385.</description>
